# Autonoumous Driving: Beginner to Master

This book aims to help beginners to learn autonomous driving from coding excercises. 
The content is organized in a bottom-up approach, by introducing local longitudinal and lateral PID controller first, and all the way up to perception.
All topics are demosntrated through closed-loop simulation using CARLA.
I found this approach is easier for students in mechanical/electrical engineering to start with.

The covered topics are:
