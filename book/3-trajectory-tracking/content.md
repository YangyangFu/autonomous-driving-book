# 3. Trajectory Following

In this chapter, we will learn how to make a vehicle follow a predefined trajectory. We will start by creating a trajectory using waypoints and then implement a controller to make the vehicle follow the trajectory. We will also learn how to visualize the trajectory and the vehicle's path in the CARLA simulator.

Trajectory following is the process of making a vehicle follow a predefined trajectory. This is achieved by implementing a controller that computes the steering, throttle, and brake commands to make the vehicle follow the trajectory. The controller can be a simple PID controller or a more complex model predictive controller (MPC).
