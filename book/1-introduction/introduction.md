## 1.2 CARLA Simulator

[CARLA simulator](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. It is developed by the Computer Vision Center (CVC) at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB). The simulator is designed to be used for training, testing, and validating autonomous driving systems. It provides a realistic environment for testing and validating the performance of autonomous driving algorithms. The simulator is built on top of the Unreal Engine, which provides a high-quality and realistic environment for testing and validating autonomous driving algorithms.
